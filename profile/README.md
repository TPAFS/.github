**Hi there, thanks for visiting our page.**

TPAFS is the github moniker of [Persius](https://persius.org). We build AI for patients fighting inappropriate health insurance denials.

Our mission is to help patients access critical care, and promote transparency, accountability, and justice.

We do this by

-  Building digital tools and software to lower the barriers consumers face (e.g. [https://persius.org](https://persius.org), [https://overturn-predictor.persius.org](https://overturn-predictor.persius.org)).
-  Acquiring and maintaining data that allow people to access opaque but vital information (e.g. [https://github.com/TPAFS/transparency-data](https://github.com/TPAFS/transparency-data), and [https://github.com/TPAFS/public-records](https://github.com/TPAFS/public-records)).
-  Analyzing and modeling such data (e.g. [https://github.com/TPAFS/investigations](https://github.com/TPAFS/investigations)).
-  Reporting on barriers, prevalent behaviors, policy, and perverse incentives plaguing the health industry (e.g. [https://blog.persius.org/](https://blog.persius.org/) and [https://blog.persius.org/investigations](https://blog.persius.org/investigations)).

**We are actively seeking financial support.**

Please reach out with questions, comments, critiques, suggestions, or to express interest in getting involved.
