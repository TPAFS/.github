**Hi there, thanks for visiting our page.**

TPAFS is the github moniker of [Persius](https://persius.org).

Our mission is to advocate for patients, end injustices and improve systems in US healthcare.

We do this by

-  Building digital tools and software to lower the barriers consumers face (e.g. [https://persius.org](https://persius.org)).
-  Acquiring and Maintaining data that allow people to access opaque but vital information (e.g. [https://github.com/TPAFS/transparency-data](https://github.com/TPAFS/transparency-data), and [https://github.com/TPAFS/public-records](https://github.com/TPAFS/public-records)).
-  Reporting on barriers, prevalent behaviors, policy, and perverse incentives plaguing the health industry (e.g. [https://blog.persius.org/](https://blog.persius.org/)).

**We need all the help we can get, and would appreciate your support in any form.**

Please reach out with questions, comments, critiques, suggestions, or to express interest in getting involved.
