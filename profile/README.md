**Hi, thanks for visiting our page!**

This is the github homepage of [Persius](https://persius.org). 

We build AI for patients fighting inappropriate health insurance denials.

Our mission is to help patients access critical care, and promote transparency, accountability, and justice.

We do this by

-  Building digital tools and software to lower the barriers consumers face.
-  Acquiring and maintaining data that allow people to access opaque but vital information.
-  Analyzing and modeling that data.
-  Reporting on barriers, prevalent behaviors, policy, and perverse incentives plaguing the health insurance industry.

**All of our services are free. If you find our work useful, please consider donating to support our development.**
